# Stitchy

My wife loves to crochet, and likes to challenge herself by making new rectangular patterns from images she finds online. To support her ~~addiction~~ hobby, I'm building a web-app to help her generate these patterns.

## Goals / To Do

- [ ] `Create` a grid of x-width and y-height
- [ ] `Create` a grid by total size in inches/cm and average stitch block size
- [x] `Upload` an image to overlay the grid
- [x] `Rotate`, `Scale`, `Transform` the image onto the grid
- [ ] `Process` the image using either black & white or dominant color per grid block
- [ ] `Print` or `Save` the generated image

## Development

This project does not have any build tools, but you can choose to install the yarn/npm dependencies to activate linting settings.
