# Stitchy

My wife loves to crochet, and likes to challenge herself by making new rectangular patterns from images she finds online. To support her ~~addiction~~ hobby, I'm building a web-app to help her generate these patterns.

## Goals / To Do

- [x] `Create` a grid of x-width and y-height
- [ ] `Create` a grid by total size in inches/cm and average stitch block size
- [x] `Upload` an image to overlay the grid
- [x] `Rotate`, `Scale`, `Transform` the image onto the grid
- [x] `Process` the image using either black & white or dominant color per grid block (click the red button)
- [ ] `Print` or `Save` the generated image (right-click to save as works)
- [ ] Make everything look pretty

## Development
